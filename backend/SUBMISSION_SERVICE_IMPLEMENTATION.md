# Submission Service Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented task 6.1: "Create backend submission service" with all required functionality including submission creation, storage, retrieval, performance metrics, and error handling.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Submission Service (`pkg/services/submission_service.go`)
- **ProcessSubmission**: Handles code submission by executing code against test cases and storing results
- **GetSubmissionByID**: Retrieves individual submissions by ID
- **GetUserSubmissions**: Retrieves user submissions with pagination
- **GetProblemSubmissions**: Retrieves submissions for a specific problem
- **GetUserProblemSubmissions**: Retrieves submissions for a specific user and problem
- **GetUserSubmissionStats**: Calculates comprehensive submission statistics

### 2. Submission Handlers (`pkg/handlers/submission_handlers.go`)
- **CreateSubmission**: POST `/api/v1/submissions` - Creates new submissions
- **GetSubmission**: GET `/api/v1/submissions/:id` - Retrieves specific submissions
- **GetUserSubmissions**: GET `/api/v1/submissions/me` - Gets current user's submissions
- **GetUserSubmissionStats**: GET `/api/v1/submissions/stats/me` - Gets user statistics
- **GetProblemSubmissions**: GET `/api/v1/problems/:problemId/submissions` - Gets problem submissions

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems
- **Execution Service**: Integrated with existing code execution system
- **Repository Layer**: Uses existing submission repository for data persistence
- **User Progress**: Updates user progress when submissions are accepted
- **Authentication**: Proper user authentication and authorization

## API Endpoints

### Submission Management
```
POST   /api/v1/submissions                    - Create submission
GET    /api/v1/submissions/:id               - Get submission by ID
GET    /api/v1/submissions/me                - Get current user submissions
GET    /api/v1/submissions/user/:userId      - Get user submissions (admin only)
GET    /api/v1/submissions/stats/me          - Get current user stats
GET    /api/v1/submissions/stats/:userId     - Get user stats (admin only)
GET    /api/v1/problems/:problemId/submissions - Get problem submissions
```

### Query Parameters
- `page`: Page number for pagination (default: 1)
- `page_size`: Items per page (default: 20, max: 100)
- `problem_id`: Filter submissions by problem ID

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Submission Creation and Storage
- Validates submission requests (user ID, problem ID, language, code)
- Executes code against all test cases (public and hidden)
- Stores submission with performance metrics (runtime, memory usage)
- Updates user progress for accepted submissions
- Returns filtered results (only public test case details)

### ✅ Submission Result Processing and Storage
- Processes execution results and determines submission status
- Stores performance metrics (runtime in ms, memory in KB)
- Handles all submission statuses: Accepted, Wrong Answer, Time Limit Exceeded, etc.
- Stores error messages for failed submissions

### ✅ Submission History Retrieval with Pagination
- Paginated retrieval of user submissions
- Filtering by problem ID
- Sorting by submission date (newest first)
- Efficient pagination with "has next" indicator

### ✅ Performance Metrics Calculation and Storage
- Runtime measurement in milliseconds
- Memory usage tracking in kilobytes
- Average performance calculations
- Acceptance rate calculations
- Statistics by submission status

### ✅ Comprehensive Error Handling
- Input validation with detailed error messages
- Repository error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Service-level error handling and logging
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## Security Features
- User authentication required for all endpoints
- Users can only access their own submissions (unless admin)
- Input validation to prevent malicious submissions
- Proper error messages without exposing sensitive information

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for service and handler layers
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Mock Testing**: Proper mocking of dependencies
- **Error Scenarios**: Testing of all error conditions

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient pagination to handle large datasets
- Proper database indexing through existing repository layer
- Minimal data transfer (filtered test results)
- Async user progress updates (with error logging)

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 4.1 ✅
**WHEN a user clicks "Submit" THEN the system SHALL run the solution against all test cases including hidden ones**
- Implemented in `ProcessSubmission` method
- Executes against all test cases (public and hidden)
- Returns overall results without exposing hidden test case details

### Requirement 4.2 ✅
**WHEN submission is successful THEN the system SHALL display acceptance status, runtime, and memory usage statistics**
- Returns comprehensive submission response with status, runtime, and memory metrics
- Calculates and stores performance statistics

### Requirement 4.3 ✅
**WHEN submission fails THEN the system SHALL show which test case failed and provide the expected vs actual output**
- Returns detailed test results for public test cases
- Provides error messages for failed submissions
- Shows expected vs actual output for failed test cases

### Requirement 4.4 ✅
**WHEN a solution is accepted THEN the system SHALL update the user's progress and problem completion status**
- Automatically updates user progress when submission is accepted
- Tracks first solved date and best submission
- Maintains attempt counts

### Requirement 4.5 ✅
**IF a solution times out or exceeds memory limits THEN the system SHALL provide specific feedback about the performance issue**
- Handles timeout and memory limit exceeded statuses
- Provides specific error messages for performance issues
- Tracks and reports performance metrics

### Requirement 5.2 ✅
**WHEN a user views submission history THEN the system SHALL show all past submissions with timestamps, status, and performance metrics**
- Comprehensive submission history with pagination
- Includes timestamps, status, and performance metrics
- Supports filtering by problem

### Requirement 5.3 ✅
**WHEN a user clicks on a past submission THEN the system SHALL display the submitted code and test results**
- Individual submission retrieval with full details
- Includes submitted code and test results
- Proper access control (users can only view their own submissions)

## Files Created/Modified
- `backend/pkg/services/submission_service.go` - New submission service
- `backend/pkg/services/submission_service_test.go` - Service unit tests
- `backend/pkg/handlers/submission_handlers.go` - New submission handlers
- `backend/pkg/handlers/submission_handlers_test.go` - Handler unit tests
- `backend/pkg/handlers/submission_integration_test.go` - Integration tests
- `backend/pkg/execution/execution.go` - Added ExecutionServiceInterface
